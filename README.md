# Jiblet-LeKaiju-Orbitas-AmmoPouch

I wanted the [old ammopouch mod](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/320-le-kaiju-orbitas-ammopouch/) to work (credit to LeKaiju and Orbitas for that)

So I put it into a blender with [Revingly's Medical SICC](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/270-medical-sicc-case-micc/).

And pulsed for 30 seconds.

The resulting Ammo Pouch is available from Ragman for 50,000 rubles.

It is 3x3 cells and can hold bullets and ammo boxes.

You can put it in your secure container. And thanks to Poltergeist on Discord, you can even strap it to your arm in the armband slot if you like.
